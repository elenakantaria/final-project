Proposal

This project is an e-commerce store and an online art gallery that sells posters of brutalist architecture.
It is like an online museum of brutalism and social-modernism. 

As I have spent my childhood in post-soviet Russia,ugly monumental constructivist and brutalist buildings were a part of my everyday scenery. They have made a certain impact on my social life, and later when i grew up I started seeing beauty in them. Those brutalist buildings of the XX century (that are now spread all over Europe, Latin America and USA) are ugly, uncomfortable, but yet honest and romantic.
