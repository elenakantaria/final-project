Proposal

This project is an e-commerce store and an online art gallery that sells posters of brutalist architecture.
It is like an online museum of brutalism and social-modernism. 
As I have spent my childhood in post-soviet Russia,ugly monumental brutalist buildings were a part of my everyday scenery. They have made a certain impact on my socila life, and later when i grew up I started seeing beauty in this type of architectural flow. Those brutalist buildings of the XX century are ugly, uncomfortable, but yet honest and romantic.
